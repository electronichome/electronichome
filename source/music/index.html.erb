          <p>There are whole house audio systems now available at almost every budget. Most of our premiere systems use speaker wire run throughout your home to in-ceiling, in-wall and freestanding speakers, accented by critical listening areas and media rooms.</p>

          <p>Our customers also want systems that can incorporate wireless zones and streaming content from services like iTunes and Spotify. Electronic Home has combined these technologies to create hybrid systems that solve difficult installations.</p>

          <p>Control systems make these systems easy to operate from keypads, phones and tablets. Scenes like "Entertain" provide background music with volume and EQ balanced from room to room with the touch of a button.</p>

    <p>Advances in wireless technologies allow us to offer wireless audio systems for existing homes, apartments and other rentals. EH has chosen to represent <b>SONOS</b> due to their product offerings, award winning app and the fact that they really do offer access to "All the music on Earth". Although Sonos offers several self-contained, boxed solutions, we often use the Sonos CONNECT and CONNECT AMPs to tie into traditional systems and speakers. We also use these as problem solvers getting audio into areas that were previously either not possible or practical.</p>
