        p In today’s technology driven world it’s essential to be able to transmit video. Front door cameras and baby monitors have been driving that need for years, but modern technology has brought on even more possibilities. Monitoring everything in and outside of the home from anywhere in the world can easily be done on your phone or PC. Checking on who is coming to see you or watching the kids play while you work is invaluable.

        p Along this same line, many clients are starting to see the value of streaming video signals to multiple rooms in the house 50. This allows someone to finish up a movie in the kitchen while others continue to watch it in the theater. If entertaining, the kids may want to watch the movie in the playroom while the adults watch in the living room.

        p Electronic Home has consistently stayed at the forefront of technology and video distribution is no exception. We attend HDMI training from Jeff Boccaccio of DPL Labs-one of the best in the industry. We also have many certified Crestron digital media employees. We stay on top of all of the emerging technologies including HDBaseT distribution systems and the newer 4K (UltraHD) resolutions.
